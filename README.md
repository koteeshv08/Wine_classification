Our goal is to discover whatâ€™s the quality of a wine considering only its chemical properties.

Our dataset is downloaded from UCI open repository and is composed by the following features:

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
quality

Implemented Decision Tree classifier to classify wine based on quality which ranges from 0-6. We have also used PCA to get rid of unnecessary features. Metrics used are - precision, recall, f1 score, and accuracy.
